Alright let's


finish this section with a simple programming exercise. Let's declare 2 variables, and set  a to red, and b, set it to blue. Now when we log these on the console, obviously we're going to get red and blue. Right? 




Now what I want you to do, is to write some code here to swap the value of these two variables. So when we log these on the console, instead of
getting red and blue, we're going to get blue and red. So pause




the video, spend a couple of minutes on this exercise, when you are done come


back and continue watching.


Alright to swap the value of two variables we


need a third variable. So we're going to declare another variable



let's call it c, we're going to use that as a backup.


So whatever you're storing in a, we're going to put that in



another variable that is c, then we're going to copy b to a


and finally what we have in c, which was the value of a before


we're going to copy that to b. Let me show you.


So we declare c, and set it to a.


So what we have in a which is red will be copied to c.


Now we want to overwrite a with b. So we set


a to be. The value of b is copied to a, now


both these variables at this point are blue. Finally


we're going to copy what we have with c which is the


original value of a, we're going to copy that to b. So we set b


to c, now, when we save the changes, instead of


red and blue we're going to see blue and red. So this proves


that we have swapped the value of these two variables. Now if you
